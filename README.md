This project is written in Python and contains both the server and the client sides.
The game startup file is _init_ and it relies on the server, which is the server.py page, which uses user conversions to access DATA, which is the json, and also the text file fild with words.
The image file is just for beauty.
Hope you enjoyed the game,
Yocheved
